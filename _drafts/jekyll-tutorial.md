This weekend I decided to give my outdated personal website an update.

// TODO: Make a table of contents

    - Using rbenv I installed ruby version 2.5.3

1. Jekyll installation
1. Jekyll walkthrough (go through the [tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) first!)
1. Jekyll overview

1. Using jekyll with GitHub Pages
