My current fields of interest are electrical and software engineering.

While the field of electrical engineering has a plethora of subfields to choose from, my main interest has been in the subfields of signal processing and communication. I enjoy the math associated with signal processing as well as the vast array of use cases for the field ranging from electrical communication and image processing to quantitative analysis in financial markets. Prior to this semester, I was unaware of the depth of knowledge involved with the field of communcation and during this semester I've grown to really enjoy the field.

While learning about communication, I've learned a decent amount about [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) and its use with software-defined radio(SDR). In learning about SDR and it's place in communcation I've also began taking an interest in cognitive radio.

As far as software engineering is concerned, lately I've been split between machine learning and operating system development. While I've had an interest in operating system development for some time, only recently have I been spending a significant amount of time learning about, and applying my knowledge in, the area. Concerning machine learning, I've been spending a signifcant amount of time learning the fundamentals of artificial neural networks. This involves the different types of neural networks available, how to construct them, and how to use them. I like to view machine learning as another application of signal analysis.

My goal currently is to bring these interests together into my master's thesis along with one other topic, FPGA's.
