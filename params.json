{"name":"Joshua Edgcombe","tagline":"Engineer & Developer","body":"### Hello.\r\nMy name is Joshua Edgcombe and I am an Electrical Engineering major at [Grand Valley State University](http://www.gvsu.edu/) in Allendale, Michigan with a strong background in software development. I originally learned to program in 2008 and have since learned to develop software in eight programming languages in a variety of environments including web, native, and embedded. I also have experience in test driven development in addition to using git for version control.\r\n\r\nMy biggest interest lies in embedded systems development. I am familiar with both the Atmel ATMega328P(via Arduino) and Parallax's Basic Stamp microcontrollers. I also have experience working with various integrated circuits including 555 timers, various logic gates, and Digilent FPGA's. Having a significant background in web development, system administration, and digital design I am also very capable of developing software and hardware for the IoT.\r\n\r\nCurrently I spend the majority of my time studying and working on schoolwork, but in my free time I'm typically exercising, reading, or working on personal projects. I'm a lifelong learner and will take every opportunity I can to learn something new. Growing up in Grand Rapids I have also grown fond of having a craft beer with a couple friends to unwind at the end of a long week.\r\n\r\n### I have experience with...\r\n\r\n### Languages, Markups, & Notations\r\n+ Python\r\n+ Java\r\n+ C\r\n+ C++\r\n+ PHP\r\n+ Basic\r\n+ Perl\r\n+ Verilog\r\n+ Javascript\r\n+ jQuery\r\n+ Bash shell scripting\r\n+ SQL\r\n+ HTML5\r\n+ CSS3\r\n+ JSON\r\n+ XML\r\n+ LaTeX\r\n+ Markdown\r\n\r\n### Libraries, Frameworks, and API's\r\nJava:\r\n+ Android SDK\r\n+ AWS SDK\r\n\r\nJavascript:\r\n+ jQuery\r\n+ jQueryUI\r\n+ Pixastic.js\r\n\r\nPython:\r\n+ Standard Library\r\n+ PySide (Qt)\r\n+ unittest\r\n+ pytest\r\n+ mock\r\n+ Requests\r\n+ lxml\r\n+ Django\r\n+ Sphinx/reStructuredText\r\n+ boto\r\n\r\nPHP:\r\n+ AWS SDK\r\n\r\nPerl:\r\n+ Standard Library\r\n\r\nWeb:\r\n+ Bootstrap\r\n\r\n### Content Management System's\r\n+ Magento Ecommerce\r\n+ WordPress\r\n+ Drupal\r\n+ Expression Engine\r\n\r\n### Contact Me\r\n+ [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/josh.edgcombe)\r\n+ [Github](https://github.com/midimaster21b)\r\n+ [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuaedgcombe)\r\n+ [Stack Overflow](https://careers.stackoverflow.com/joshuaedgcombe)\r\n+ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/midimaster21b)\r\n+ [joshedgcombe@gmail.com](mailto:joshedgcombe@gmail.com)\t","google":"UA-22750309-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
