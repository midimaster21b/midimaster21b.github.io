# Hello

## About Me

My name is Joshua Edgcombe and I am an Electrical Engineering major at [Grand Valley State University](http://www.gvsu.edu/) in Allendale, Michigan with a strong background in software development. I originally learned to program in 2008 and have since learned to develop software in many different programming languages in a variety of environments including web, native, systems, and embedded. I also have experience in test driven development in addition to using git for version control.

My biggest interest lies in embedded systems development. I am familiar with both the Atmel ATMega328P(via Arduino) and Parallax's Basic Stamp microcontrollers. I also have experience working with various integrated circuits including 555 timers, various logic gates, and Digilent FPGA's. Having a significant background in web development, system administration, and digital design I am also very capable of developing software and hardware for the IoT.

Currently, I spend the majority of my time studying and working on schoolwork. In my free time I'm typically exercising, reading, or working on personal projects. I'm a lifelong learner and will take every opportunity I can to learn something new. Growing up in Grand Rapids I have also grown fond of having a craft beer with a couple friends to unwind at the end of a long week.
